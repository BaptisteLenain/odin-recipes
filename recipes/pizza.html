    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Good quick and easy. I don't add any extra salt though. I also sub cottage cheese for ricotta, and sprinkle some parmesan on top. The addition of a little cheddar to lasagna is just really good for some reason! (If any of you haven't tried the "new" ready to use lasagna noodles do it soon-they work great and are sure a time saver-no more wet,hot,torn noodles for me)!</p>
