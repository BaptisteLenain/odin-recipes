    <h1>Pain perdu</h1>
<img src="../recipes/pain_perdu.jpeg">
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Yes, pain perdu is French toast, but a superior one. Unlike regular French toast, this batter cooks into a custardy, crispy coating that leaves the bread creamy and oh so good. The use of good egg bread is a must here. Homemade is best; however, store-bought (such as Hawaiian bread) will work in a pinch. A fresh squeeze of lemon juice and a good dusting of powdered sugar on each serving is traditional.
